# Summary Notes

- `DISTINCT` and `GROUP BY` provide insights into aggregated slices of the data.
- `COUNT`ing the quantity of a group member can provide valuable insight.
- Compound conditions can be joined by `AND` in queries.
- `HAVING` further filters aggregated data, in addition to filtering applied to raw data by the WHERE clause.

Next, we'll learn how to combine datasets using the `JOIN` command.
