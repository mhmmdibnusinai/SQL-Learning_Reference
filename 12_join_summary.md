# Summary Notes:

- `INNER JOIN` is the most common joining type, and is the default assumed, if you only include the command word `JOIN` in your query.
- `ON` is the phrase to specify the matching unique identifier in both tables.
- If the matching key columns in both tables have exactly matching names `USING(column_name)` may be used instead of the `ON` command structure.
- When combining tables, the column or field names must include a way for SQL to correctly identify their source table. This is accomplished by providing the full table name or assigning an **alias**, as was demonstrated in the Query Question #2.
- Appropriate use of `WHERE` clause filters can enable queries to narrow the focus of the inquiry and search rapidly through very large datasets quickly containing millions of records.
- As shown in the final query, there are many tools for manipulating text fields and including specific parts in your reports as you answer stakeholderâ€™s questions. Some of these essential tools are `SUBSTRING`, `POSITION`, `COALESCE` and `CASE` statements, which are all coming in the next sections.
