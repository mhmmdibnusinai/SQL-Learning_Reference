# IV.3. Summary Notes:          
•	SQL Subqueries provide an ability to ask more questions at one time.            
•	The interior subqueries are executed first and then the outer loop. Thus, data can be created, collected or calculated on the inner loop and fed to the outer loop.            
•	Subqueries are inserted with at least the `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses and are separated from the rest of the query by using parentheses.            
•	`FROM` - to replace a static table with a temporary table, with a great opportunity for additional calculated values either within the temporary table or on the outer loop.            
•	`WHERE EXISTS` – to create dynamic filtering criteria inside of this subquery function and draw information from another table without joining to it.              
•	`WITH` table `AS` – for selecting a unique set of data, potentially from multiple tables, before you begin the main query.                  
•	Test each component of your subquery separately to ensure that it is returning accurate results and providing insights to the original question or problem.
