# Summary Notes

- `SELECT` and `FROM` are the most essential parts of every query.
- Selected data may request all `(*)`, specific columns or calculated values.
- Formal referencing of data includes the sourcing table (table.data).
- `WHERE` is a valuable tool for filtering data for the desired output.
- `ORDER BY` sorts the query results, ascending (ASC) is the default.
